# Discord

!!! info
     Let the *Staff* know that you want to run your own bot instead of the Notifiarr bot so we can enable it for your account. *Keep in mind this is a Sub feature.*

## Dev portal

There are tons of tutorials online about creating a Discord bot, it is super simple. After you have created your bot and you are on the page where you copy your bot token, make sure you check the intents

### Privileged Gateway Intents

- PRESENCE INTENT
- SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
- MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT

After you have created the bot, invite it to your server. It will show offline for now and that is fine & expected.

## Your Server

Now that you have added the bot to your server you need to get the bots id. Right click on the bot and select the bottom option "Copy User ID"

## Notifiarr Website

After the Admins have enabled it you simply need to go to your profile and in the Notification section is a place for the Bot Token and Bot Id. Add those pieces of information and click save so the site will create a container for your bot.

Since you already added the bot to your server above, once you hit save it should only take a few seconds for the bot to show online in your server
